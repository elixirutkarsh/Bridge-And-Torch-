The Three Switches Puzzle:
To determine which switch controls each light bulb, you can follow these steps:
Turn on the first switch and leave it on for a few minutes.
After some time has passed, turn off the first switch and turn on the second switch.
Enter the room with the light bulbs.
Now, observe the bulbs:

If one bulb is on, that corresponds to the second switch.
If one bulb is off but warm, that corresponds to the first switch.
If one bulb is off and cool, that corresponds to the third switch
